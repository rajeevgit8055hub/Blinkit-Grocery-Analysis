# 📊 BlinkIT Grocery BI Dashboard Analysis

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of BlinkIT’s grocery operations, highlighting trends in sales, customer ratings, and inventory performance across various outlet types, item categories, and geographic locations. The dashboard features dynamic KPI cards, DAX-driven metrics, and multiple chart types designed to uncover critical business patterns. It demonstrates how data visualization can convert raw operational data into actionable insights—supporting strategic expansion, customer satisfaction improvement, and performance optimization.

---

## 🏢 Project Context

BlinkIT operates in a highly competitive grocery retail space, where understanding what sells, where it sells, and how customers respond is critical. However, the business lacked a centralized analytics solution to monitor these metrics in real-time. This Power BI project addresses the need for clarity in product performance, outlet analysis, and customer preferences by turning large-scale operational data into a user-friendly, interactive dashboard tailored for various stakeholders including marketing, operations, and analytics teams.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objective is to build a centralized business intelligence solution using Power BI to help stakeholders:

- Analyze sales performance by product type, fat content, and outlet size.
- Understand how inventory trends correlate with customer satisfaction.
- Compare regional performance using outlet location and establishment year.
- Present interactive KPIs such as Total Sales, Average Sales, and Ratings.
- Support data-driven decisions using clean, insightful visualizations.

---

## 🔍 Target Audience

This dashboard caters to various roles within the business:

- **Operations Managers** to monitor outlet efficiency and inventory flow.
- **Marketing Teams** to design campaigns targeting high-performing SKUs.
- **Sales Executives** to track regional and outlet-level performance.
- **Business Analysts** to identify patterns in customer behavior and stock trends.

---

## 🛑 Business Problems Addressed

Before this solution, BlinkIT faced multiple analytical blind spots:

- ❌ No consolidated view of KPIs such as average sales or customer ratings.
- ❌ Lack of insight into how fat content affected item performance.
- ❌ Difficulty comparing outlet performance by type or physical size.
- ❌ No analytics to link inventory visibility with customer satisfaction.
- ❌ Absence of interactive, real-time dashboards for fast decisions.

## 💡 Key Features & Visual Insights

### 1. KPI Cards

The dashboard includes four key performance indicators that update dynamically:

- 🟢 **Total Sales** – Overall revenue from all items sold.
- 🔵 **Average Sales** – Revenue per transaction or item.
- 🟡 **Number of Items Sold** – Total SKUs moved.
- 🔴 **Average Rating** – Customer satisfaction across product types.

### 2. Total Sales by Fat Content

A doughnut chart displays sales distribution between Regular and Low Fat items, showing a near 50-50 split. This balanced preference provides insight into customer health awareness and informs future product stocking.

### 3. Average Sales by Item Type

A horizontal bar chart breaks down performance by item categories. Dairy, Household, and Snack Foods outperform others, while Baked Goods and Health items show lower engagement, highlighting opportunities for promotional efforts or repricing.

### 4. Sales by Fat Content & Outlet Type

Using a stacked column chart, this visual explores how various outlet types perform relative to product fat content. The data reveals consistent performance across outlet formats with slight regional fat preference shifts, supporting more localized stocking decisions.

### 5. Sales by Outlet Establishment Year

A line or waterfall chart visualizes sales growth based on the year each outlet was opened. Outlets launched after 2017 contribute heavily to revenue, proving that newer infrastructure aligns well with customer demand.

### 6. Sales by Outlet Size

This pie or doughnut chart identifies that Tier 2 outlets lead sales with ₹369.28K, outperforming both Tier 1 and Tier 3. This trend suggests BlinkIT should prioritize mid-sized outlets for expansion.

### 7. Sales by Outlet Location

Using a funnel chart, the dashboard shows sales volume distribution across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations. Tier 2 outlets dominate, while Tier 1 underperforms, indicating untapped potential in more urban zones.

### 8. All Metrics by Outlet Type

A matrix table summarizes key metrics by outlet format:

| Outlet Type         | Total Sales | Avg Sales | No. of Items | Avg Rating | Item Visibility |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Grocery Store       | ₹74,251.71  | 141.16    | 526          | 3.93        | 56.31           |
| Supermarket Type 1  | ₹739,886.89 | 139.92    | 5,235        | 3.92        | 338.65          |
| Supermarket Type 2  | ₹122,388.20 | 142.08    | 863          | 3.93        | 56.62           |
| **Total**           | ₹936,526.79 | 141.38    | 6,624        | 3.92        | 451.58          |

This matrix offers a consolidated performance view, helping identify which outlet models drive volume, satisfaction, and visibility.
